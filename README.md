# Roulette-Simulation
Welcome to the Roulette Simulation Application! This project is a simple yet engaging simulation of a classic roulette game built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to experience the thrill of betting on a roulette wheel, complete with options to bet on colors or specific numbers.
